# csa_simulator

A simulator for (first and foremost) Frame Asynchronous Coded Slotted ALOHA (CSA)
the simulator is used to evaluate the performance of this multiple access technique 
and compare it with other techniques. 

The simulator might be extended to handle other forms of CSA as well, and to be more user friendly. 

Right now the simulator can be used by defining the desired simulation parameters in main.cpp, compiling the project
and running. 

The performance is evaluated in terms of packet loss rate and packet delay.

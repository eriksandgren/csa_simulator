# csa_simulator

Simulator for FA-CSA, FS-CSA and SC-CSA.

Parameters can be changed in the Parameters.hpp file.
The projects need to be rebuilt once the parameters are changed, this is best
done by using the commands in the project folder
>> make clean

>> make

The simulator can then be run by executing the produced binary 'Simulator',
once simulation is done the results can be viewed in the results.txt file
(or other specified name).
